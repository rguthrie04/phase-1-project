Phase 1 Project


Search Google Library
Create a My Library app that let's you browse books using the Google API and see a full set of details re any book available.  The API should return the image thumbnail of the book, including the author, and title of the book. A button with a click listener will also be added so the user can go to the book on Google. 


Event Listeners: 
1 -Submit: submit the name,title, etc of the book and return results.
2 - Add a clear button that clears all results
3) Allow a user to click a button to go to a new browser tab and view the book information
